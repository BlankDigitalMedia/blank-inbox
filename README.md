# Blank Inbox

A modern, self-hosted email client built with Next.js, Convex, and React. Designed for **single-tenant** use—one instance per user.

## Features

- 📧 Full email inbox with send/receive capabilities
- 🔐 Secure password-based authentication (single user)
- 📝 Rich text email composer with drafts
- 🏷️ Email organization: Archive, Star, Trash, Drafts
- 🧵 Email threading support
- 🌓 Dark/light theme toggle
- 📱 Responsive design
- 🔒 HTML email sanitization (XSS protection)
- ⚡ Real-time updates with Convex

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Convex account** (free tier available at [convex.dev](https://convex.dev))
- **Email provider** (choose one or both):
  - [Resend](https://resend.com) for sending/receiving
  - [inbound.new](https://inbound.new) for sending/receiving

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd blank-inbox
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Convex

```bash
# Login to Convex
npx convex login

# Initialize project (creates convex deployment)
npx convex dev
```

This will:
- Create a new Convex project (or link existing)
- Output your `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
- Start watching for schema changes

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and set:

```env
# Required: Your Convex deployment URL (from step 2)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://[your-project].convex.cloud

# Optional: Restrict signup to specific email
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com

# Email providers (at least one recommended)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key
NEXT_INBOUND_API_KEY=sk_your_inbound_api_key
```

**Set email provider keys in Convex** (for backend access):

```bash
npx convex env set RESEND_API_KEY re_your_resend_api_key
npx convex env set NEXT_INBOUND_API_KEY sk_your_inbound_api_key

# Optional: Set ADMIN_EMAIL in Convex
npx convex env set ADMIN_EMAIL your-email@example.com
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 5. Create Your Account

1. You'll be redirected to `/signin`
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Enter your email and password
4. Click "Sign Up"

**Note:** Only the **first signup** is allowed. After that, the instance is locked to a single user. If you set `ADMIN_EMAIL`, only that email can sign up.

### 6. Configure Email Webhooks (for receiving)

To receive emails, configure your provider's webhook:

**Webhook URL:** `https://your-domain.com/api/inbound`

**For Resend:**
1. Go to [Resend Dashboard → Webhooks](https://resend.com/webhooks)
2. Add webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/inbound`
3. Subscribe to `email.received` events

**For inbound.new:**
1. Go to [inbound.new Dashboard](https://inbound.new/dashboard)
2. Set webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/inbound`
3. Configure your inbound email address

## Email Provider Setup

### Option 1: Resend (Recommended for sending)

1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Get API key from [API Keys page](https://resend.com/api-keys)
3. Set `RESEND_API_KEY` in `.env.local` and Convex
4. Configure webhook for receiving (see step 6 above)

### Option 2: inbound.new (Great for receiving)

1. Sign up at [inbound.new](https://inbound.new)
2. Get API key from dashboard
3. Set `NEXT_INBOUND_API_KEY` in `.env.local` and Convex
4. Configure your inbound email address
5. Set webhook URL to your `/api/inbound` endpoint

### Dual-Provider Setup (Best of both)

- Use **Resend** for sending (more reliable)
- Use **inbound.new** for receiving (simpler setup)
- Set both API keys—app will automatically use the right one

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Set environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL` (optional)
4. Set Convex environment variables (see step 3 above)
5. Deploy!
6. Configure email webhooks with your Vercel URL

### Deploy Elsewhere

Blank Inbox works on any Node.js hosting platform:

- **Cloudflare Pages** (with Node.js)
- **Railway**
- **Render**
- **Self-hosted VPS**

Requirements:
- Node.js 18+ runtime
- HTTPS (for webhooks and secure cookies)
- Environment variables support

## Security Notes

🔒 **Single-Tenant Design:** This app is designed for ONE user per instance. If you need multi-user support, deploy separate instances.

🔒 **Password Security:** Passwords are hashed with bcrypt. No plaintext storage.

🔒 **XSS Protection:** Email HTML is sanitized with DOMPurify before rendering.

🔒 **HTTPS Required:** Always use HTTPS in production for secure authentication.

🔒 **Webhook Security:** Consider IP whitelisting or signature verification for webhooks.

## Development

### Available Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

### Testing

See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for manual testing guide.

## Troubleshooting

### "Signup is disabled" error

This means a user already exists. This is by design—only one user per instance.

**To reset:**
1. Go to [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev)
2. Select your project → Data → `users` table
3. Delete all users
4. Refresh `/signin` and sign up again

### Emails not appearing

1. Check Convex logs: `npx convex logs`
2. Verify webhook URL is correct (HTTPS, publicly accessible)
3. Test webhook with provider's test tool
4. Verify API keys are set in Convex: `npx convex env list`

### Authentication issues

1. Clear browser cookies
2. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` is set correctly
3. Check middleware.ts is protecting routes
4. Run `npx convex dev` to ensure schema is deployed
